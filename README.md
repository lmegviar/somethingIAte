A hassle-free alternative to elimination diets

"Something I Ate allows you to keep a flexible diet while helping you to identify potential problem foods."

This application provides a simple way to track associations between adverse symptoms and common "problem foods" for those 
who suspect that their diet may be negatively impacting their health. This easy-to-use app determines which problem 
foods are most likely to be causing your symptoms. Simple log in at the end of each day, mark whether or not you've 
experienced symptoms, and check off the potentially problematic foods you've eat from that day. Something I Ate does 
the rest, providing you with an ordered list of the most likely culprits.

### Problem 
Elimination diets take time and commitment. Even with careful adherance, it can be difficult to determine 
which foods, if any, are truly to blame for one's symptoms.

### Solution 
Something I Ate allows the user to simply track their diet and occurence of symptoms and determines 
correlations, without the need for extensive avoidance of any one food group.

### How to Get Started Simply login to Something I Ate at the end of each day and record whether or not you experienced 
any negative symptoms and check off the potentially problematic food groups you ate from that day. That's it! Over time, 
Something I Ate will continue to update your stats, providing an increasingly accurate anaylsis of which foods are most 
associated with your negative symptoms.
